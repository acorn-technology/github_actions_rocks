# Build Android App with docker

Add a workflow to [acornSmartWatchTuner](https://github.com/acorn-technology/acornSmartWatchTuner)

This shows use of Docker to build an Android app.

In this case, the app source code is old and would need an update in order to be supported on the latest Android toolsâ€š but a docker image containing legacy Android tools is used to work around this.
