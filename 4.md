## Converting README.md to a workflow

Note the advanced build instructions in [The Battlesnake Readme](BattleSnake-cpp-client/README.md)

Let's replace this with a workflow in [Battlesnake-cpp](https://github.com/cfogelklou/BattleSnake-cpp-client)

We can prove the build instructions are correct on the chosen platform because building and testing on fresh VM succeeds.
